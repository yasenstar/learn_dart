### What is Dart?

Dart is an open-source, structured, and flexible programming language developed by Google, particularly oriented for web develoopment, but not exclusively.

Behind Dart are __Lars Bak__ and __Kasper Lund__, two of the authors of the V8 Javascript engine for Google Chrome.

__Gilad Bracha__ was also involved in the creation of Dart. Barcha is the author of Newspeak Programming Language, co-author or Java Specifications and the 2nd edition of the Java Virtual Machine Development.

Dart code runs over DartVM (Dart Virtual Machines), which is 2 times faster than JavaScript.

### Advantages of Using Dart?

- Its high performance
- Its simplicity and clarity when you use it and most importantly when you have to learn it
- Google Dart developers and the open-source community have created great documentation, including tutorials and samples.
- Its ability to use a full IDE just out of the box, which is known as Dart Editor
- Asynchronous Programming
- You can use Dart to develop web applications, but in addition, you can use Dart to develop command-line applications and server-side applications as well.
