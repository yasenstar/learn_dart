## 1. Beyond Dart's Bascis

### Benefits of Modularity in Software Development

During Development Phase:

- Each module requires less code
- New features or changes can be introduced to modules in isolation, separate from the other modules
- Errors can be easily identified and fixed in a modules
- Modules can be built and tested independently
- Programmers writing the modules can collaborate on the same application
- The same modules can be reused in many applications
- Applications have a main module and many auxiliary modules. Each module encapsulates a specific functionality and each one is integrated through loosely coupled communication channels provided by the main module

During Post-Production Phase:

- Modules kept in a versioning system can be easily maintained and tested
- Fixed and noninfrastructural changes in a module can be done without affecting other modules

### One significant Disadvantage of Modularity

It increases complexity when managing many modules, especially when each one is individually versioned, updated, and has dependencies on the other modules.

### Modularity in Dart

Modularity in Dart is realized through **Packages, Libraries, and Classes**.
